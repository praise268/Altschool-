    <p>
      I joined AltSchool Africa’s School of Engineering, specializing in Cloud
      Engineering, because I wanted a structured and practical pathway into the
      cloud computing industry. I was drawn to AltSchool’s hands-on approach,
      mentorship, and industry-aligned curriculum, which provides real-world
      experience rather than just theory. My goal is to gain in-depth knowledge
      of cloud technologies, earn industry-recognized certifications, and become
      a skilled cloud engineer capable of designing scalable and efficient cloud
      solutions. Ultimately, I want to use these skills to drive innovation,
      optimize cloud infrastructure, and contribute to impactful tech solutions
      across industries.
